In a medium saucepan, bring @water{3%cups} to a boil. Add the @pasta{1/2%cup}, @leek{1}(sliced to 1/2 inch rounds) and @salt{1%tsp} and vigorously simmer over medium-high, stirring often, until the pasta is tender, about ~{10%minutes} (or according to the pasta’s cooking directions). In the last four minutes of the pasta cooking, add the @?kale{3%leaves}(ribs removed, leaves torn) and @peas{1/2%cup}. If the pasta rises above the water, add another ¼ cup water.

Turn off the heat. Scoop out about ½ cup of the hot water. To it, add the @parmesan{1%tbsp}, @miso{2%tbsp} and @ginger{1/2%tsp}(finely grated) and stir vigorously with a fork until smooth. Slowly stir the Parmesan-miso mixture into the soup. Transfer to a bowl and top with more Parmesan and black pepper or chile oil.
