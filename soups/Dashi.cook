Combine @cold water{2%quarts} and the @kombu{20%g} in a medium saucepan, and place over medium heat. As soon as the water boils, remove from heat and add the @katsuobushi{20%g}, pushing it gently into the water to submerge (don’t stir vigorously). Steep for ~{5-10%minutes}. Strain and discard the kombu and katsuobushi (or reserve to make another batch of weaker dashi) and return the dashi to the saucepan. Keep warm, but don’t let it boil.
